    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hey there — I’m Jared, the guy behind JB Old Skool Games.  
      This isn’t a big repair company or a commercial shop — it’s a personal passion project that grew from my love of the original Xbox and the joy of seeing old hardware come back to life.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m based in Huntsville, Alabama, and I primarily serve the local area, working with fellow retro gaming enthusiasts who want to keep their original Xbox consoles running strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each console I work on gets the same care and attention I’d give my own collection.  
      My goal is simple: to help keep these amazing machines alive and running for another 25 years — 
      whether it’s fixing failed capacitors, cleaning out years of dust, or restoring the original look and feel of your system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks for stopping by, and I hope this site helps you learn a bit about why these consoles are worth saving — and how we can keep them going strong.

    <h3>Why the Original Xbox?</h3>
    <p>
      The Original Xbox was a console ahead of its time — powerful, moddable, and built like a tank.  
      Two decades later, these systems deserve a second life.  
      There’s something special about hearing that startup chime again and knowing it’s running stronger than ever.

    <h3>Let’s Keep It Alive</h3>
    <p>
      Every restored console is a piece of gaming history saved from being forgotten.  
      Together, we can make sure the spirit of early 2000s gaming keeps shining bright — one Xbox at a time.
