  <h2>Why Restore Your Console?</h2>

  <p>
    The Original Xbox and other consoles from the early 2000s are now over <strong>20 years old</strong>.  
    While they were built tough, many of the components inside weren’t designed to last this long.  
    Capacitors leak, thermal paste breaks down, and mechanical parts like DVD drives and fans start to fail.

    <h3>Preserving Gaming History</h3>
    <p>
      Each console represents a piece of gaming history — and letting it die from preventable issues 
      is a shame. Restoring your Xbox doesn’t just keep it running; it preserves a unique era of modding, 
      innovation, and community that made the system special.

    <h3>The Hidden Dangers of Aging Components</h3>
    <p>
      Many Xbox consoles suffer from <strong>leaking capacitors</strong> that slowly eat away at the motherboard’s 
      traces — a problem known as <em>trace rot</em>. Once this damage occurs, the board can be beyond repair.  
      Similarly, dried-out <strong>thermal paste</strong> can lead to overheating, shortening the life of your CPU and GPU.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the time to replace these components now prevents serious long-term damage.  
      A little preventive maintenance goes a long way in keeping your console running smoothly.

    <h3>Built for the Next 20 Years</h3>
    <p>
      When properly restored, an Original Xbox can easily last another two decades.  
      New capacitors, fresh thermal paste, cleaned fans, and re-lubricated drives all contribute 
      to long-term reliability.  
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to make sure every console I touch is ready for another generation of gaming — 
      whether you’re reliving Halo LAN parties or introducing your kids to the classics.

    <h3>Preventive Care vs. Reactive Repair</h3>
    <p>
      Most repairs I see could have been avoided with early maintenance.  
      Once corrosion sets in, fixing the damage becomes much harder (and more expensive).  
      That’s why I focus on restoration and preventive work — it’s the best way to keep 
      these old systems alive and stable.

    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Restoring these consoles isn’t about flipping them or collecting dust on a shelf.  
      It’s about <strong>keeping playable history alive</strong>.  
      These machines helped shape gaming as we know it, and they deserve the care 
      to keep running for years to come.
