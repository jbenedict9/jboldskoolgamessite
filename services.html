  <h2>Services & Pricing</h2>

  <p>
    I’m not a company — just a guy who loves keeping these old consoles alive.  
    Below is a breakdown of what I offer, how the process works, and what you can expect when you bring your console in for service.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h3>1. Diagnostic Fee</h3>
    <p><strong>Price:</strong> $25</p>
    <p>
      Every repair starts with a diagnostic. I’ll inspect and test your console to determine what’s wrong.  
      The fee covers the time spent testing and evaluating — but if you decide to go forward with a repair or restoration, 
      this $25 is <strong>deducted from your total cost</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>2. Maintenance / Restoration Package</h3>
    <p><strong>Price:</strong> $65</p>
    <p>
      This is my most popular option — perfect for an Xbox that still works but needs some TLC to stay that way.  
      It includes a full teardown, cleaning, and replacement of key wear components.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>🧹 Blow out dust and debris</li>
      <li>🧼 Clean plastic components (shell, buttons)</li>
      <li>🔧 Clean fan and power supply</li>
      <li>💿 Clean DVD drive and replace drive belt</li>
      <li>🔋 Inspect capacitors and replace clock capacitor</li>
      <li>🪛 Clean motherboard and components</li>
      <li>❄️ Replace CPU and GPU thermal paste</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This restores your Xbox to peak performance and gives it a fresh start for the next 20 years.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Additional Repairs (Outside the Package)</h3>
