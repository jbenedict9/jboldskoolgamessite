  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <p>
    Here are some of the most common questions I get about my restoration work, consoles I sell, and how you can keep your own system running strong.
  </p>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h3>Where do you get the consoles that you sell?</h3>
    <p>
      Most of the consoles I restore come from yard sales, auctions, or local listings.  
      Every now and then I’ll come across a rare or heavily damaged unit — those are my favorite to bring back to life.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do you restore or repair other people's consoles?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, absolutely!  
      I work on customer consoles as well as ones I find myself.  
      Each repair is handled with the same care and attention as if it were my own system.
    </p>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do you work on other consoles besides the Original Xbox?</h3>
    <p>
      My main focus is the Original Xbox — it’s where I have the most experience.  
      That said, I’m always up for a challenge.  
    </p>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h3>Why don’t you usually include controllers with your consoles?</h3>
    <p>
      Controllers are tough to come by in good condition.  
      Many used ones have worn sticks, cracked shells, or damaged cords.  
      When I have quality controllers available, I’ll offer to include one with your purchase.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h3>Can I still play Xbox Live on these restored systems?</h3>
    <p>
      Official Xbox Live for the Original Xbox was shut down in 2010 — but you can still play online!  
      Check out <strong>Insignia Live</strong>, a fan-made replacement network that brings online play back to life.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do they make wireless controllers for the Original Xbox?</h3>
    <p>
      They sure do!  
      The company <strong>Retro Fighters</strong> makes an excellent modern wireless controller that works great with the Original Xbox.  
      It’s comfortable, reliable, and keeps the classic feel alive without the cable clutter.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do you sell restored consoles?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes!  
      Every console I sell has been fully cleaned, recapped where needed, had its DVD drive serviced, and been tested for several hours of playtime before it’s listed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h3>Can I send in my console for repair?</h3>
    <p>
      Definitely.  
      You can reach out via email to start a diagnostic: <a href="mailto:jboldskoolgames@gmail.com">jboldskoolgames@gmail.com</a>   
      Once I check it out, I’ll give you a full report and quote before any work begins.
