    <h2>🎮 Thank You for Choosing JB Old Skool Games!</h2>
    <p>
      I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you for trusting me with your console restoration or repair. 
      Every system I work on gets the same care and attention that I’d give my own, and it means a lot to know 
      there are still folks out there who appreciate these classic machines as much as I do.
    </p>

    <p>
      While your console has been fully tested and restored, keep in mind that these systems are now 
      over 20 years old — and sometimes old hardware can still surprise us.  
      If you run into <strong>any issues at all</strong>, please don’t hesitate to reach out.
    </p>
